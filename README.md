Research Work - Data Mining
-------------------
- Developed a research project in Python, based on “Data Analytics Platform for Continuous Chronic Disease Surveillance on Social Media”, which benefits public health agencies to reduce/eliminate major risk factors & precursors of diseases.
- Developed Python functionalities using NLP techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Added keyword filtering mechanism that collects and tweets. To extract features, asthma-related keyword & phrases are applied.
- Implemented different classification models to detect asthma users, age identification, age-range classification, gender prediction, clustering and pattern finding. 
- Converted data into algorithm understandable format, trained Machine Learning model such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Multi-class (One-vs-All) classification, etc.
- Generated ROC curves to present one model’s performance and Compare each different Machine Learning Algorithms at the same time via multi-class classification settings. 
- Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Processing, Feature Extraction, Classification, Prediction and Visualization tasks were performed using Twitter API, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, matplotlib, Json, datetime libraries.
